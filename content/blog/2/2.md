###Once upon a time there was an old cat, called Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who was an anxious parent. She used to lose her kittens continually, and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief!

###On baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard.

###She caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom.
